# WordBrain-solver
A solver for the ios game "WordBrain" using C++

This program runs on a console.

A couple of known issues:
1. Words like 'key ring' aren't in the dictionary.
2. There are 2 dictionaries I used here, in case the default dictionary doesn't cut it.
3. for an empty letter (in case you select a word and the grid is no longer full) insert '0'.
